      <p class = "page-paragraphs">One day we were sitting around bored and thought that we should build a website but then we got even a better idea we decided to make a restruant.
          My sister and I found <br> our late Grandma's recipe box and we decided to immortalize her cooking through our restruant!

      <h2 class="headers2"> Our Misson</h2>
      <p class = "page-paragraphs">Our Grandma had a massive family that was comprised of 8 children and she always had the philosophy that no one should go hungry. We understand espeically now more than ever there are people that go to bed hungry and or dont have enough funds to be able to eat out. So our goal is to create a hub whereas you can support us but most importantly you will be able to easily access recipes that have fed armies!</p>
     
      <h2 class= "headers2"> What makes us different than any other ordinary restaurant?</h2>
      <p class = "page-paragraphs">Our goal is that every meal that we sell we will give away one to a family in need.</p>
